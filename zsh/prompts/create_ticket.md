**Prompt for Generating Structured, Detailed GitHub Issues Using An Issue Template**

*Objective:* Use the provided GitHub issue template to create a complete, structured, and actionable issue description for the task specified in $TASK_DETAILS.

   - List **Main Actions** that define the scope and requirements, using clear language and references to any relevant scripts, resources, or documentation links.
   - Establish **Acceptance Criteria** with measurable, specific items that define when the task is complete.

2. **Ensure Thoroughness and Completeness**:
   - Include **Technical Details** covering any critical code references, libraries, or configuration requirements.
   - Identify any **Dependencies** such as related tasks or external resources, ensuring all prerequisites are clearly noted.
   - Define a clear **Definition of Done** that includes any testing, validations, or review processes needed for issue closure.

3. **Strictly Follow Template Structure**:
   - Use each section of the template in order, providing detailed information for each part.
   - Avoid redundancy by referring to relevant sections or attachments as needed.
   - In **Attachments**, include only essential links, files, or resources that add meaningful context or requirements.

4. **Use Clear, Consistent Language**:
