To build this Ruby script, you'll need to interact with the GitHub API to fetch the relevant issues and their details. Here’s a basic outline for the script:

1. GitHub API Interaction: You'll need to authenticate and query the GitHub API for issues assigned to you.

2. Data Aggregation: Once you have the issues, you can parse and summarize the data.

3. Goal Matching: You’ll need to cross-reference the ticket details with your pre-existing list of goals and roles.

4. Output Summary: Finally, format and print the summarized data.

Required Libraries:

net/http: For making HTTP requests.

json: To parse responses.

Optionally, you can use octokit for GitHub API interaction (more user-friendly).

Example Ruby Script

require 'net/http'
require 'json'
require 'date'

# Configuration

GITHUB_TOKEN = 'your_github_token_here' # Add your GitHub token
GITHUB_USERNAME = 'your_github_username_here'
REPO = 'your_repo_name_here' # Optional if you want to narrow down by repo

# Fetch issues assigned to the user

def fetch_issues
  uri = URI("<https://api.github.com/search/issues?q=assignee:#{GITHUB_USERNAME}+is:issue+state:open>")
  req = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri)
  req['Authorization'] = "token #{GITHUB_TOKEN}"

  res = Net::HTTP.start(uri.hostname, uri.port, use_ssl: true) do |http|
    http.request(req)
  end

  if res.is_a?(Net::HTTPSuccess)
    JSON.parse(res.body)
  else
    puts "Error fetching issues: #{res.message}"
    exit
  end
end

# Summarize the data

def summarize_issues(issues)
  summary = issues['items'].map do |issue|
    {
      title: issue['title'],
      url: issue['html_url'],
      created_at: issue['created_at'],
      closed_at: issue['closed_at'],
      state: issue['state'],
      body: issue['body']
    }
  end

  summary
end

# Match issues to goals and role

def match_goals_to_issues(issues_summary, goals)
  matches = issues_summary.map do |issue|
    goal_match = goals.select { |goal| issue[:body].include?(goal) }
    {
      title: issue[:title],
      url: issue[:url],
      goal_match: goal_match.empty? ? 'No goal match' : goal_match.join(', '),
      summary: issue[:body]
    }
  end

  matches
end

# Output summary

def output_summary(matches)
  puts "\n### Achievements Summary ###"
  matches.each do |match|
    puts "Title: #{match[:title]}"
    puts "URL: #{match[:url]}"
    puts "Matched Goal(s): #{match[:goal_match]}"
    puts "Summary: #{match[:summary][0..100]}..." # Truncate summary for brevity
    puts "--------------------------------------------------"
  end
end

# Pre-existing list of goals (can be expanded)

goals = [
  "improve communication", "increase participation", "frontend mastery", "team leadership"
]

# Main flow

issues = fetch_issues
issues_summary = summarize_issues(issues)
goal_matches = match_goals_to_issues(issues_summary, goals)
output_summary(goal_matches)

Key Elements:

1. Authentication: You need a valid GitHub token with repo or read:issues scope to access the issues.

2. Query Structure: The script searches for issues assigned to your username (assignee:#{GITHUB_USERNAME}).

3. Goal Matching: Basic string matching between issue descriptions and your predefined goals.

4. Output Formatting: Summarizes and prints the matched issues, goals, and a brief body excerpt.

Script Execution in Zsh

To run this script from zsh:

1. Save it as summarize_issues.rb.

2. In your .zshrc or .zsh_aliases, add an alias:

alias summarize_issues="ruby ~/path_to_script/summarize_issues.rb"

3. Then, you can run it from the terminal by typing summarize_issues.

Hurdles/Limitations:

1. API Rate Limiting: GitHub imposes rate limits on API calls. If you’re fetching a large number of issues, you may hit these limits.

2. Token Scopes: Ensure your GitHub token has the right permissions to access the necessary repositories.

3. String Matching: The current goal matching is basic and based on string search in the issue body. You might need more advanced parsing or NLP to handle this better.

4. Issue Volume: If you have many issues, you may want to implement pagination in the API requests (per_page and page query parameters).

Let me know if you'd like to refine this further, or if there's any specific functionality you want to add!
