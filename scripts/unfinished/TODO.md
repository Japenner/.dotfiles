# Script Ideas

- Build a Github Issue ticket based off of the current branch's changes.
- Write a script to assess package.json and Gemfile to determine system specs to pass into openai API for higher quality prompt responses.
  - What specs and configurations do I need about the ecosystem I work in to enhance the prompts I give chatgpt?
- Write a sript to save issues and their solutions in a personal database that I can reference whenever I run into the same issue again.
- Write a script to take output from the last command including the command itself and feed it to openAI's chatGPT if it is an error and then paste back or save output as remediation steps to set error.
  - Make this a manual process
- Script builder based on modular patterns taken from other scripts generated. For instance, assigning options based upon Ruby OptionsSet (?) class.
