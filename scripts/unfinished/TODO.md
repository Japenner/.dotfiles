# Script Ideas

- Build a Github Issue ticket based off of the current branch's changes.
- Write a script to assess package.json and Gemfile to determine system specs to pass into openai API for higher quality prompt responses.
  - What specs and configurations do I need about the ecosystem I work in to enhance the prompts I give chatgpt?
- Write a sript to save issues and their solutions in a personal database that I can reference whenever I run into the same issue again.
