If the user clicks back, the form seems to unintentionally go to the main summary page instead of the review summary section.\n\nCase 2: When on the review page of the form, when only one item has been added, after removing the last item, the user is taken to the new item page. If the user begins to fill in a field, the cancel button appears at the bottom of the page. If the user clicks this, they are able to return to the review page without filling out the required field. This is in the required flow, and so should necessarily have an item filled in. Additionally, if the user attempts to submit the form, it is correctly blocked, but the error message seems irrelevant.\n\nCase 3: When on the review page of the form, when only one item has been added, after removing the last item, the user is taken to the new item page. If the user presses back, they are taken to the first page in the Array Builder flow. Then if they press continue, they return to the new item page. If they fill in data and press continue, they are taken to the next screen in the flow, rather than returning to the review page.\n\n## What I expected to happen\n\nPossible solutions: (Adam Antonioli notes)\nCase 1: Perhaps removing the back button, and using the cancel and continue design of the edit flow could fix this.\nCases 2: Seems like removing the cancel button from appearing would prevent this possibility.\nCase 3: Not sure here. Perhaps removing the back button would prevent this, however this locks the user on this page until they have filled out the required field(s).\nAs far as I can tell, all these solutions would require a re-design or modification of the existing Array Builder Platform component.\n\n## Urgency\n\nHow urgent is this request?

Please describe.**\r\n\r\nAccording to our audit, there are 87 forms that require multiple signatures. We cannot digitize these forms until we create a pattern to handle the routing of a form to multiple parties to collect their digital signature.\r\n\r\n**Describe the solution you'd like**\r\nI'd like a team to propose a solution and then test that with users. Here is how this might work:\r\n* We collect some basic information from the form submitter to determine who needs to sign the form. This will vary from form to form and perhaps sometimes we'll know a group to route the form to rather than relying on the user to tell us. But for this initial work we'll focus on the use case where the user knows who the form needs to be signed by. \r\n  * Basic information for the additional signers would be something like Name, email address, and some identifying PII (Date of birth?) - Needs guidance from Security folks.\r\n* When a form is submitted, we don't submit it to the back-end but instead hang onto the submission in save-in-progress DB or a similar place. We fire off a notification to the identified 3rd parties that need to sign.\r\n* The notification (email) contains a uniquely generated link for the signer which brings them to va.gov, likely asks them to authenticate (unless we can get away with the LoROTA pattern here where we just ask for any PII we gathered about the signer) and shows them the data the user submitted with the statement of truth component.\r\n* The signed \"signs\" by typing their name into the statement of truth.\r\n* Once all signers have signed, likely detected by a background job checking on the status, the form is then submitted to the appropriate API and sent to the system of record for processing.\r\n\r\n**Describe alternatives you've considered**\r\nWell, one alternative is what we do now, which is to not support forms that require multiple signatures. But that blocks 87 forms from being fully digitized. Another alternative is to make the user print out the form and get it signed, then return and use the Direct Upload functionality we are working on to submit the form. That could be an MVP of supporting this path for these forms but, it's basically sneaker net, not a real solution. Another potential solution is a 3rd party service, like a DocuSign. But those require that all parties create a duplicative account with that service which we don't want to force users to do.\r\n\r\n**Additional context**\r\nThis is a design gap ticket. Thus it is an identified issue that needs a solution. The solution needs to come from a VFS team that does some discovery, builds a prototype, tests that out with users, and then ships that solution. We'd then document this pattern in the Design System, perhaps codify parts of it in the Forms Library, which would allow other teams to use the pattern in their forms.","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"20-10207 508 Open Ticket","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1220","state":"CLOSED","createdAt":"2024-04-12T22:59:31Z","updatedAt":"2024-07-22T14:34:49Z","body":"**Description**\n\nNow that all items are remediated for 20-10207, let's file the 508 audit.\n\n**Definition of done**\n\n- [x] Open 508 issue [508 Template Instructions](https://depo-platform-documentation.scrollhelp.site/developer-docs/request-support-from-the-va-508-office#RequestsupportfromtheVA508office-AuditRequest)\n- [x] [Add to VFF 508 Log](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/blob/main/Accessibility/508-audits.md)","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"Supporting Artifacts & Release Plan in preparation to go live","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1223","state":"OPEN","createdAt":"2024-04-17T13:58:00Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-05T22:51:49Z","body":"-[ ] Update supporting artifacts page in preparation to go live\n-[ ] Create release plan\n","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"4. 21-4138 Write Product Guide for Content","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1225","state":"OPEN","createdAt":"2024-04-17T14:01:34Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-05T22:51:49Z","body":"-[ ] Write Product Guide\n-[ ] Create Product Guide ticket and add Product Guide\n","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"21-4142 - Update List & Loop with new pattern","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1251","state":"OPEN","createdAt":"2024-04-25T22:56:48Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T20:01:31Z","body":"- [ ] Update the existing form to use the new multi page pattern for Medical Facilities","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"form-upload:  Verify forms to use in Beta ","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1258","state":"CLOSED","createdAt":"2024-04-29T21:33:28Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T21:53:48Z","body":"- [x] [Verify a list of forms to use](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1R-BElCjCEnqM-NBQAQBPZtVaH022x2pLafC3JPJGkjw/edit?gid=0#gid=0)\n- [ ] Check which page has data to not form name, OBM information, personal information","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"21-4138 - Reduce submissions - Official Pilot run through","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1259","state":"CLOSED","createdAt":"2024-04-30T19:14:15Z","updatedAt":"2024-09-19T15:21:08Z","body":"- [ ] Run through pilot with coded prototype\n- [ ] Update Research Plan, link Prototype\n- [ ] Create [research issue -](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-research-repository/projects/1) \n\n\nWe may be able to run our pilot with one of the folks [in this list](https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/va.gov-team-sensitive/blob/master/Administrative/vagov-users/team-veterans.md)","repository":{"name":"VA.gov-team-forms","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms"}}},{"content":{"title":"Convert list & loop to use new pattern - array- multi page - builder for form 20-10207 & 21-4142","url":"https://github.com/department-of-veterans-affairs/VA.gov-team-forms/issues/1260","state":"OPEN","createdAt":"2024-04-30T20:53:56Z","updatedAt":"2024-11-19T20:01:32Z","body":"- We have two forms 20-10207 Priority Processing & 21-4142 Request medical treatment that use the old version of the array pattern.

Forms that travel through the Benefits Intake API and into Central Mail can be accepted but don't always make it to the System of Record. When the form submission fails to reach the intended destination, the user is unaware and potentially under the assumption that their form submission is being worked on.\n2. User expectations are not properly set such that they would know when to follow up with the VA if they have not received any status on their submission.\n3. Forms not related to a claim or appeal that are saved \"in progress\" show up in draft status in MyVA (Benefit applications drafts) but then are not shown to the user anywhere on VA.gov once that form is submitted. The next contact the user may get from the VA would be when the form was processed. Leaving a potentially long gap between submission and the next communication from the VA.\n\n\n## **Product Outline**\n\nThere are two main parts to this work:\n\nA. Revising the form confirmation page for forms using the Benefits Intake API to convey to the user that their form submission is pending until it reaches the system of record (i.e. not fully received)\nB. Conveying the current status, which we can obtain by polling the Benefits Intake API post-submission, to the user.\n\nMy Veteran-facing Forms team is going to take on part A and assist with part B, including documenting the process for other teams to follow. We currently poll the Benefits Intake API and reflect that status in Datadog thus we can help with obtaining the status. Chante's team is going to help us get that status into MyVA and put that in front of the user. \n\nReflecting status to the user also supports the work to provide QuickSubmit-like form upload capability on VA.gov.

There is no validation of their paper form and they have to send it in via snail mail which, according to USPS takes on average 2.5 days.\nWhat the need is: We need a solution for submitting PDF forms filled out by-hand. Ideally that solution would accept a form, potentially validate it in some way, then submit the form to the appropriate back-end system, then provide a text and/or email confirmation that the form was received.\n\nProject objectives\n\nThe Veteran-facing Forms team will conducts two tests:\n\n1. Heuristic evaluation of QuickSubmit. This is to determine if the tool meets the basic accessibility requirements to be able to conduct a usability test with users of assistive tech. If the tool does not meet this minimum bar then the tool is not fit for purpose and the usability test will not continue.\n2. Usability test of QuickSubmit. User research with at least 10 participants, of whom at least 3 will be users of assistive tech. We will recruit users through Perigean with the goal of finding folks who actually need to submit a form that QuickSubmit accepts. We also need folks who have IAL2 level authentication already established as QuickSubmit appears to require that level. We’ll focus on the 10 examples below where we currently point users to QuickSubmit.\n\nWhat we’ll produce: Research findings and recommendations in the standard VA slide deck for sharing research.\nIF (and only if) we make a recommendation that the user experience of the QuickSubmit tool meets the minimum bar for VA.gov then we’ll talk to the Intake and Delivery Services team to determine the level of monitoring and observability the team has for the tool, the tech stack the tool is built on, and other concerns related to interoperating with a tool not owned by the Platform. From that discovery we’ll produce a document detailing what would need to happen to be able to point more users at QuickSubmit.\nNOTE: QuickSubmit currently makes the user re-authenticate even if they are already authenticated using Login.gov or ID.me (I re-verified this on 1/19). That would have to be fixed if we decide this is a viable path.\n\nOpen questions\n\n* To our understanding, there is no staging environment for QuickSubmit. Thus we’ll need to test in production. That requires us recruiting users who need to submit an actual form OR agreement from the Intake and Delivery Services team that they will promptly delete any files uploaded during our testing. We’re not sure Perigean can recruit with this level of specificity and we’ve not yet engaged the team to see if they can delete uploaded files quickly.\n\nWhat we won’t cover\n\nWhile we’ll ask some context setting questions regarding a user’s previous experience with QuickSubmit we will not be attempting to uncover what or who generates user traffic to QuickSubmit today.\nWe’ll also try to avoid overlapping with any research regarding QuickSubmit vs. Ask VA as a document upload path, or at least we’ll coordinate these efforts so that any overlap is intentional.\n\nContextual statements\n\nQuickSubmit sits under the Intake and Delivery Services team within the Business transformation service within the Office of Business Integration (OBI). Tim Wagner and Jacob Shepherd are on the Intake and Delivery Service team. They report to Melissa Fiedler who reports to John Clark (Chief) who reports to Derek Herbert (Director). This team (well, Tim Wagner at least) believes this tool “can’t get any easier”.\nQuickSubmit replaced Direct Upload as “the online tool to share documents with VA’s Evidence Intake Center”. It has 406,500 active registered users as of 10/24/2023. Groups uploading files via QuickSubmit include Disabled American Veterans, American Legion, and Veterans of Foreign Wars.
