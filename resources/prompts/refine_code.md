**Prompt for Code Refinement with Error Handling, Logging, Redundancy, and Performance Considerations:**

*Objective:* Refactor and optimize the given code to enhance readability, maintainability, extendability, error handling, logging, redundancy, and performance while reducing complexity. Ensure the code adheres to SOLID principles and follows best practices for clean, scalable software design. **Break out new classes or modules where applicable to promote modularization and separation of concerns.**

**Instructions:**

**Priority Order**:

1. Simplify Complexity
2. Improve Readability
3. Error Handling and Logging
4. Reduce Redundancy
5. Ensure Maintainability and Extendability
6. Optimize Performance

---

1. **Simplify Complexity**:
   - Break down functions longer than 15 lines into smaller, single-purpose functions.
   - Eliminate deeply nested structures and complex conditionals by refactoring into manageable components.
   - Replace complex conditional logic with polymorphism, such as using classes with a shared interface.

2. **Enhance Readability**:
   - Use clear and descriptive names that convey intent. Example: Replace `x` with `submission_count`.
   - Follow consistent naming conventions and coding standards.
   - Add meaningful comments where necessary, but prefer refactoring over excessive commenting.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Add appropriate error handling, ensuring that only expected and recoverable errors are suppressed.
   - Log significant actions and errors, including relevant context (e.g., `INFO`, `DEBUG`, `ERROR`).
   - Include structured logging, capturing key-value pairs for better traceability.

4. **Reduce Redundancy**:
   - Identify and eliminate duplicate logic.
   - Consolidate repeated code into reusable methods or modules to promote DRY principles.
   - Remove unused variables, parameters, and functions to declutter the code.

5. **Maintainability and Extendability**:
   - Design the code for future changes, using interfaces and abstract classes where appropriate.
   - Implement common design patterns like **Factory**, **Strategy**, or **Decorator** to make the codebase flexible.
   - Reduce coupling between components to make unit testing more feasible and effective.

6. **Optimize Performance**:
   - Identify performance bottlenecks such as nested loops or redundant queries.
   - Where applicable, use caching, lazy loading, or deferred execution to enhance performance.
   - Ensure optimizations do not introduce additional complexity without significant benefit.

7. **General Best Practices**:
   - Version control: Ensure commits are descriptive and changes are documented.
   - Critical Paths: Add unit or integration tests for key business logic or significant changes.
   - Consider scalability: Externalize configurations that might change in different environments.

*Output:* A refactored version of the given code that is simpler, more readable, adheres to SOLID principles, effectively handles errors and logging, reduces redundancy, and is optimized for performance while being easier to maintain and extend in the future. Include a **brief summary** of changes made and the rationale behind major structural decisions.
